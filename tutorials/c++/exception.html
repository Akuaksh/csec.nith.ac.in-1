<h1>C++ Exception Handling</h1>
An exception is a problem that arises during the execution of a program. A C++ exception is a response to an exceptional circumstance that arises while a program is running, such as an attempt to divide by zero.Exceptions provide a way to transfer control from one part of a program to another.
<br><br>
C++ exception handling is built upon three keywords:<b><i> try, catch, and throw.</i></b>
<br>

<br><b>   throw: </b> A program throws an exception when a problem shows up. This is done using a throw keyword.
<br><b>   catch: </b> A program catches an exception with an exception handler at the place in a program where you want to handle the problem. The catch keyword indicates the catching of an exception.
<br><b>   try:</b> A try block identifies a block of code for which particular exceptions will be activated. It's followed by one or more catch blocks.
<br><br>
<h3> Detecting a Exception (Try Block)</h3>
When a function might cause an exception, and therefore includes a statement that throws
an exception, the call to the potentially offending function should be placed within a try
block. A try block consists of one or more statements that the program attempts to execute,
but which might result in thrown exceptions. 
<br><b>For Example: </b><br>
<pre><div id="Box">
int main()
{
 int value;
 try
 {
  value = getUserNumber();
 }
  cout &lt&lt "Data entry value is " &lt&lt value &lt&lt endl;                              
  // rest of the program goes here
}
 P.S. this program is incomplete you can't use try block without catch block.
</div>
</pre>

<br>
<div id="Box">
<b>Note :</b>
1. try block consists of one or more statements that are guaranteed to throw exceptions when executed.<br>
2. You want to place a function call in a try block when the function might throw an exception, because placing it in
    a try block allows you to handle the problem that caused the exception.<br>
3. When a try block contains just one statement, you still must enclose the statement in curly braces.
</div>

<h3>Throwing Exception</h3>
Exceptions can be thrown anywhere within a code block using throw statements. The operand of the throw statements determines a type for the exception and can be any expression and the type of the result of the expression determines the type of exception thrown.<br><br>

Following is an example of throwing an exception when dividing by zero condition occurs:
<pre>
<div id="Box">
double division(int a, int b)
{
   if( b == 0 )
   {
      throw "Division by zero condition!";
   }
   return (a/b);
}
</div>
</pre>
<h3> Catching Exception</h3>
To handle a thrown object, you include one or more catch blocks in your program immediately
following a try block. A catch block contains statements that execute when an exception is
thrown and includes the following components:
<pre>
* the keyword catch
* a single parameter in parentheses
* an opening curly brace
* one or more statements that describe the exception action to be taken
* a closing curly brace
</pre>
<b>For Example</b>
<pre>
<div id="Box">
try
{
   // protected code
}catch( ExceptionName e )
{
  // code to handle ExceptionName exception
}
</div></pre>

Above code will catch an exception of ExceptionName type. If you want to specify that a catch block should handle any type of exception that is thrown in a try block, you must put an ellipsis, ..., between the parentheses enclosing the exception declaration as follows:
<pre><div id="Box">
try
{
   // protected code
}catch(...)
{
  // code to handle any exception
}
</div>
</pre>
The following is an example, which throws a division by zero exception and we catch it in catch block.
<pre><div id="Box">
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

double division(int a, int b)
{
   if( b == 0 )
   {
      throw "Division by zero condition!";
   }
   return (a/b);
}

int main ()
{
   int x = 50;
   int y = 0;
   double z = 0;
 
   try {
     z = division(x, y);
     cout &lt&lt z &lt&lt endl;
   }catch (const char* msg) {
     cerr &lt&lt msg &lt&lt endl;
   }

   return 0;
}
</div>
</pre>

Because we are raising an exception of type const char*, so while catching this exception, we have to use const char* in catch block. If we compile and run above code, this would produce the following result:
<br><b><pre><div id="Box">
           		 Division by zero condition!
</div></b>
</pre>
